# 👋 Hi, I'm Ajinkya Temgire

## 🧠 About Me

I am an **AI & Data Science Engineer** with a strong focus on **Generative AI and Agentic Systems**. I enjoy building reliable, production-ready AI applications that solve real-world problems.

My background includes hands-on experience with **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP**, and modern **LLM-based architectures**. Alongside engineering, teaching complex AI concepts has helped me build strong fundamentals and clarity in system design.

* Designed and implemented a **multi-agent AI framework** to automate end-to-end data science workflows including data loading, exploration, visualization, coding, and model development.
* Built specialized agents for CSV ingestion, file management, pandas analysis, visualization, ML coding, and shell execution coordinated through a central team manager.
* Integrated tool-based execution using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and filesystem operations with controlled permissions and safety constraints.
* Implemented context memory, session state handling, and task delegation to enable collaborative agent reasoning.

### 🔹 Agentic Chatbot using LangGraph

* Designed a **stateful agentic workflow** using LangGraph
* Implemented tool usage, controlled execution, and conversational persistence
* Focused on reliability, debugging, and observability

### 🔹 Corrective RAG System (CRAG)

* Developed an **agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline** using LangGraph that validates and corrects retrieval failures before answer generation
* Implemented semantic search using FAISS embeddings and automated relevance scoring of retrieved chunks via LLM evaluation
* Designed conditional routing to trigger query rewriting and web retrieval when local knowledge was insufficient
* Built sentence-level context refinement to ensure grounded, high-precision responses
* Integrated Groq-hosted LLM inference for efficient execution
